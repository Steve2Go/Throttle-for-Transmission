# Mission

A transmission remote client for MacOS written in pure Swift with SwiftUI

# Status

It ~works~ but it's ugly and not done. I hacked this all together in a few days and will be making some pretty big changes before it will be ready for release.

#Building

Open it in XCode and change the signing profile and build.
